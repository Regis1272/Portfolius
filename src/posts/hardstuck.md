title: Hardstuck in Tutorial Hell

For the last year of my personal narrative, I’ve been on an "accelerated learning journey."

Here's what I've been learning while traversing the ceaseless, searing wastes of Tutorial Hell (when not tending to my charred soles):
- Vim motions, commands, and neovim configs (Really, this borders more on obsessive addiction).
- A new keyboard + layout ([Engrammer](https://sunaku.github.io/moergo-glove80-keyboard.html#layers) on my [Glove80](https://www.moergo.com/) – shoutout to MoErgo, Sunaku, and Arno).
- Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS, Bash scripting, Typescript, Python, multiple APIs, and a million other flowery-named npm packages.
- React, Svelte, a million bundlers.
- Data structures, data flow, data pipelines, data cleaning, data visualization. Data stuff.
- Should I use bun?
- Machine learning (okay, not really).
- UI/UX Design.
- DX Design. I discovered that half of my time was essentially going to personal DX design (vscode qwerties, laugh at me all you want). Full days of decrypting neovim configs as a newbie are not fun. Want a quantum secure encryption algorithm? Just go look at whatever nvchad and lunar are doing. [Kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), though – I love you.
- Memes.

Yeah. All this, and when it comes down to it… In this climate, I still feel unqualified to earn an entry level position (internship). After all, I'm catching up here. I got no degree. I feel behind. I'm bouncing between topics at mach speed. Maybe it's just [imposter syndrome](https://80000hours.org/2022/04/imposter-syndrome/)? Despite that, I have the will. And the "smooth, creamy feeling" of an amateurish neovim config (Thanks, [Prime](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen)).

Essentially, I've got a toe-in-the-water of everything the internet throws at me. Gotta deal with these tutorial-burns somehow.

### The Effectiveness of My Method
As you may have guessed: I am going crazy. Needlessly? Maybe – Probably… Yes. I do not *need* to know everything everywhere all at once.

To my surprise (not really—I know I'm making terrible decisions here—BUT, I CAN'T STOP), I found that this method of mine wasn't the “best” way to learn.

Well, it's not the sciencey: *“statistically the most probable ‘best way’ we can find based on the aggregated data”* type of thing, anyways. This, despite my feeling that I was taking it from a scientific approach.

I wanted to “learn optimally.” If I was going to get back into programming, why not get use to vim at the same time? Why not also purchase a split, ortholinear keyboard and learn an entirely new layout on top of all that?! With this method, surely all of my strides in learning would come together in ***a MOMENTOUS act of holistic synergy!*** I wanted it all. Still do. Right from the get-go. Why *shouldn't I* split my attention between a series of different concepts, rather than on just one, marketable skill?

Naturally, I had this reasoning: when it comes to software & web development, there isn't *just one important thing*. There are many. But nowadays, without the right mentorship, it's increasingly difficult to figure out what, exactly, *the most important things to focus on* are. And that isn't for a lack of mentorship either.

There is an ocean of mentorship to be found with a cursory google search. Some of it lives in pristine waters, some within tangled fish nets, and even more lies in massive garbage patches. For those seeking alternatives to traditional higher education, it can be a real mire. (Though, there are ways to minimize this with the advent of AI – but they are far from perfect).

I've experienced my fair share of disembodied mentorship across many places online. YouTube, Discord, learning sites like Coursera and edX, etc. Despite hearing the same platitudes over and over, I have not, in fact, been “taking it one step at a time.” I have been bouncing between my dotfiles, repos, different projects, Obsidian notes, and the Great Pacific Online Learning Patch. Somewhere along the way, I should've probably just cried out for help from a real human-being (lol).

While it’s been frustrating – even infuriating at times – I’ve enjoyed it. Neovim can be deeply satisfying (kudos, Prime). But, still. So much of it has been needlessly tiresome. And despite all the potential for flexing and "btw factor", I have yet to earn a meaningful income from any of this.

### The Fault is Mine

Please, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that online learning is to blame for *all of my struggles*. The fault is predominantly mine. I continually remind myself that the immensity of the internet is increasingly not wellbeing-oriented (and it never *truly* was).

For me, the most difficult thing has been recognizing the best time to hop off the tutorial bandwagon, and *get my own experience in*. Finding the right thing to work on is just as much of a challenge, but there are many good springboards for ideas online.

### Tenacity

I could expand on the tradeoffs between all the tools and concepts I became obsessed with, but that isn't what I'm trying to do here. Above all, I just want to say: find a thing and get good at that one thing. Show it off. What are your strengths? Being honest with yourself, what *could be* your strengths? 

If there isn't just one thing, find a set of explicitly interrelated things. And find someone to give you feedback. Be it someone you admire on GitHub, a friend, or a fellow discord kitten. Guidance, when it comes from a genuine conversation, is invaluable.

Have long-term goals; see everything else as a stepping stone along the way. *Embrace* where you are in your journey *right now*. Get comfortable with it. Your life won't start when you acquire some lofty, often obscure set of skills. You can enjoy it, even if you feel like you have to get somewhere *fast*. It's all part of the adventure. And, it's okay to have lofty goals, so long as you don't set lofty expectations of yourself.
